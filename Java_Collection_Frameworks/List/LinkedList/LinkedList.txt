** LinkedList
A LinkedList is a linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (called a node) contains a reference (or link) to the next element in the sequence. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

Node
A node in a LinkedList typically contains two parts:

Data: The value or information contained in the node.
Next: A reference to the next node in the LinkedList.
Here's a simple representation of a node in Java:

class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}




** Doubly LinkedList
A Doubly LinkedList is a type of LinkedList where each node contains references to both the next and the previous nodes. This allows traversal in both directions (forward and backward).

Here's a simple representation of a node in a Doubly LinkedList in Java:

class DoublyNode {
    int data;
    DoublyNode next;
    DoublyNode prev;

    DoublyNode(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
        this.prev = null;
    }
}




** Circular LinkedList
A Circular LinkedList is a type of LinkedList where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. This can be implemented for both singly and doubly linked lists.

Here's a simple representation of a node in a Circular LinkedList in Java:

class CircularNode {
    int data;
    CircularNode next;

    CircularNode(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}




** LinkedList in Java
Java provides a built-in LinkedList class as part of the java.util package. This class implements the List interface and provides methods to perform various operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Here's an example of how to use the LinkedList class in Java:

import java.util.LinkedList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();

        // Adding elements
        list.add(1);
        list.add(2);
        list.add(3);

        // Inserting elements at specific positions
        list.add(1, 4); // Inserts 4 at index 1

        // Removing elements
        list.remove(2); // Removes element at index 2

        // Traversing the list
        for (int element : list) {
            System.out.println(element);
        }
    }
}


The LinkedList class in Java is a doubly linked list, which means each node has references to both the next and the previous nodes. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion from both ends of the list.

Summary
LinkedList: A linear data structure with nodes containing data and a reference to the next node.
Doubly LinkedList: Each node has references to both the next and the previous nodes.
Circular LinkedList: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
LinkedList in Java: A built-in class in the java.util package that implements a doubly linked list.


** 
 * The LinkedList class is part of the Java Collection Framework and implements
 * the List interface. It allows for the storage of elements in a doubly-linked list.
 * 
 * Key features of LinkedList:
 * - Elements can be added or removed from both ends of the list.
 * - It provides methods to perform operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
 * - It allows for null elements.
 * - It is not synchronized, so it is not thread-safe without external synchronization.
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
 * list.add("Element1");
 * list.add("Element2");
 * 
 * Note: For better performance in scenarios where frequent insertions and deletions
 * are required, LinkedList is preferred over ArrayList.
