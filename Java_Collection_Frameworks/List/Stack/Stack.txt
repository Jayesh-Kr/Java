A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Stacks are used in various applications, such as expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms, and function call management in programming languages.

In Java, the `Stack` class is part of the Java Collection Framework and extends the `Vector` class. It provides methods to perform standard stack operations like `push` (to add an element), `pop` (to remove the top element), `peek` (to view the top element without removing it), `isEmpty` (to check if the stack is empty), and `search` (to find the position of an element in the stack). However, it is recommended to use `Deque` interface implementations like `ArrayDeque` for stack operations due to better performance and more consistent API design.
