** LinkedHashMap
LinkedHashMap is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is an implementation of the Map interface. It extends HashMap and maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries. This linked list defines the iteration ordering, which is typically the order in which keys were inserted into the map (insertion-order). This makes LinkedHashMap predictable in terms of iteration order.

** Key Characteristics of LinkedHashMap:
Order of Elements: Maintains insertion order. This means that when you iterate over the keys, values, or entries, they will be returned in the order they were added.
Performance: Similar to HashMap in terms of time complexity for basic operations (O(1) for get and put), but slightly slower due to the overhead of maintaining the linked list.
Access Order: Can be configured to maintain access order instead of insertion order. This means the order of iteration can be based on the order in which entries were last accessed.
Null Values: Allows one null key and multiple null values, similar to HashMap.


Differences Between LinkedHashMap and HashMap

Ordering:
LinkedHashMap: Maintains a predictable iteration order (insertion-order or access-order).
HashMap: Does not guarantee any specific iteration order.

Performance:
LinkedHashMap: Slightly slower than HashMap due to the overhead of maintaining the linked list.
HashMap: Generally faster for basic operations due to the lack of ordering overhead.

Use Cases:
LinkedHashMap: Useful when you need a predictable iteration order, such as in caching mechanisms where you might want to maintain access order.
HashMap: Suitable for general-purpose use where order does not matter.

Memory Overhead:
LinkedHashMap: Requires more memory due to the additional linked list that maintains the order.
HashMap: More memory-efficient as it does not maintain any order.
